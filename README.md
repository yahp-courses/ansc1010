## Ducks

* Reach maturity at around :
	* 8 weeks (Mules)
	* 4-6 months (Local) 

* Incubation lasts about 30 days
	* 8 - 20 eggs

## Broilers

* Incubation 21 days

### Pen Setup

* With an open sided pen, give the birds 1sqft per bird

* Select appropriate site for the bird:
	* No flooding
	* sufficient wind flow
	* close to access road
	* has utilities
	* Not where everyone can see

* Orientation of the pen:
	* The prevailing breeze should go **across** the pen (for heat removal)
	* Try to align the pen east to west (so that most of the sun gets blocked)

* Height refers to the distance between the galvanize roof and the floor

* A split level roof will allow the heat to rise and escape

* There should be at least 1 1/2 ft height of concrete (solid) walls to keep out predators etc.

* Choose between earthen and concrete floors

* Ventilation:
	* Naturally/Open Ventilated: wire fence
	* Tunnel Ventilated: closed off with environment control

* Use a deep litter system

* Feeds:
	* Broiler Starter (3 wks)
	* Broiler Finisher (6 wks) -> process

## Small Ruminants

Wild animals have large flight zones which is why you spread arms and legs to corner the sheep.

### Straddle

* Hold the hard part of the jaw
* Swing leg over 
* Squeeze the sheep shoulders firmly between the legs

Weight is useful for a number of things:
* dosage
* health
* profit
* maturity
* growth
* dressing percentage


## Estimating Weight

### Weigh tape/band 
* look at the side with the manufacturer
* throw over the animal
* measure the **heart girth** (behind the shoulder)
* ensure there are no kinks, match at the spine with hair lying flat
* the animal should be standing on all fours

### Inch tape with formula

(heart girth) x (heart girth) x Length / 300
* in inches
* Length = from front shoulder to last pin bone (next to tail)

* Looking for about 80% production

* Check mortality  to estimate the stock and then use that to check the percentage production.

* Egg collection three times a day:
	* 8
	* 11
	* 1

* Collect, clean, grade eggs

* Good litter management reduces caked litter

* Discourage a lot of birds going in the same box to roost/lay. Could lead to cracked eggs.
	* 14x14 - 8 birds
	* 12x12 -3

* 100 - 125 birds per waterer
* 50 - 60 birds per feeder 

* A **smashed** egg is a very small egg with little to no yolk

* Shelf life:
	* farmer: 2 days
	* retailer: 5 days
	* consumer: 1 week
